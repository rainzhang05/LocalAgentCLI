# LocalAgentCLI — Current State

> **Last updated**: 2026-03-19 (Target readiness now carries capability-confidence tiers across local models and remote providers, `/set`, `/models`, and `/providers` surfaces explain what the CLI believes and why, agent-mode gating rejects untrusted provider fallback states explicitly, and startup default-target repairs warn instead of silently switching targets.)

## How to Update

After implementing a component:
1. Change its status marker from `[ ]` to `[~]` (in progress) or `[x]` (done)
2. Add the date of the status change
3. Add brief notes if relevant (e.g., "partial — missing streaming support")
4. Commit this file as part of your implementation work

**Status markers:**
- `[ ]` — Not started
- `[~]` — In progress
- `[x]` — Done

---

## Phase 1 — Shell Core

| Status | Component | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `[x]` | CLI entry point (`localagentcli` command, `localagent` alias) | 2026-03-18 |
| `[x]` | Shell UI (input loop, prompt) | 2026-03-19 — prompt shows a live slash-command menu with arrow-key selection, keeps matching options visible while editing/backspacing across root and nested pickers, auto-loads repository-root `AGENTS.md` instructions, exits on consecutive idle `Ctrl+C` presses without a save prompt, and now exposes a persistent prompt-time status toolbar that can surface agent route/phase and undo availability alongside shared action/confirm prompts |
| `[x]` | Command Router (parsing, dispatch) | 2026-03-17 |
| `[x]` | `/help` command | 2026-03-19 — grouped help, command-specific help, and slash-menu metadata are all driven by per-command `CommandSpec` declarations, and router-level unknown/invalid command errors now include consistent `/help` guidance plus close-match suggestions when available |
| `[x]` | `/exit` command | 2026-03-17 |
| `[x]` | `/status` command | 2026-03-19 — `/status` now renders the expanded form of the same shared status snapshot used by the prompt toolbar, including route/phase/step, pending tool, and undo-ready counts; in agent mode, idle placeholders keep that section layout stable even when no task is active |
| `[x]` | `/config` command | 2026-03-19 — `/config` now opens an interactive schema-aware editor in TTY mode while keeping explicit dotted-key reads/writes for scripted use, and free-form edits now use the shared text-prompt helper |
| `[x]` | `/setup` wizard | 2026-03-19 — simplified for Phase 1 (workspace, mode, logging level), now uses the shared prompt contract for wizard questions, and still falls back to persisted defaults in non-interactive launches |
| `[x]` | Config system (TOML read/write) | 2026-03-17 |
| `[x]` | Config defaults and validation | 2026-03-17 |
| `[x]` | Session state dataclass | 2026-03-17 |
| `[x]` | Session manager (new/save/load/list/clear) | 2026-03-19 — invalid startup default targets are now repaired to the next valid model/provider target with one explicit warning naming the old and replacement targets |
| `[x]` | Storage manager (directory init) | 2026-03-17 |
| `[x]` | Logger (file-based, leveled) | 2026-03-17 |

## Phase 2 — Remote Models

| Status | Component | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `[x]` | Provider base class (ABC) | 2026-03-18 |
| `[x]` | Provider registry | 2026-03-18 |
| `[x]` | OpenAI-compatible provider | 2026-03-19 — model list now comes from the provider `GET /models` response with default-model fallback, streamed tool-call deltas are accumulated, capability checks are resolved per selected model id, and discovered models now carry inferred-vs-fallback readiness provenance |
| `[x]` | Anthropic provider | 2026-03-19 — model list and connection test now use the live `GET /v1/models` API with default-model fallback, mixed text/thinking/tool blocks are preserved in order for non-streaming and streaming paths, and discovered models now carry inferred-vs-fallback readiness provenance |
| `[x]` | Generic REST provider | 2026-03-19 — configurable model discovery endpoint/fields now back provider model selection, with default-model fallback plus optional mapped reasoning/tool-call fields, and discovery results now label configured-vs-fallback readiness provenance |
| `[x]` | API key manager (keychain + encrypted) | 2026-03-18 |
| `[x]` | `/providers add` command | 2026-03-19 — provider type/name/base URL/API key/test-now prompts now share the same picker/text/secret/confirm contract as the rest of the shell |
| `[x]` | `/providers list` command | 2026-03-19 — now shows selected model context plus `model unselected`, `api discovered`, or `legacy fallback` readiness state when known |
| `[x]` | `/providers remove` command | 2026-03-18 |
| `[x]` | `/providers use` command | 2026-03-19 — retained as a hidden compatibility alias behind `/set`, now explicitly states whether it auto-bound a live-discovered model or only a legacy fallback |
| `[x]` | `/set` target-selection command | 2026-03-19 — unified picker for local models and provider models, with provider model selection starting empty instead of prefilled and picker descriptions now surfacing readiness tiers and discovery state; legacy-fallback provider selections now add explicit post-selection guidance to refresh discovery and pick an API-discovered model |
| `[x]` | `/providers test` command | 2026-03-19 — now reports both connectivity and whether model discovery succeeded live or fell back to legacy provider defaults, with standardized fallback guidance phrasing and clearer provider-creation failure context; `/providers` parent-command errors now include explicit `/help providers` recovery guidance |
| `[x]` | SSE streaming support | 2026-03-19 — normalized chunk pipeline now preserves final text, reasoning, tool calls, notifications, errors, and done events consistently across providers |
| `[x]` | Model abstraction layer | 2026-03-19 — `generate()` now collects the same normalized stream pipeline used by `stream_generate()` |

---

## Phase 3 — Local Models

| Status | Component | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `[x]` | Model registry (`registry.json`) | 2026-03-19 — ModelEntry now persists capability provenance alongside boolean capability flags, with backwards-compatible defaults for older registry entries |
| `[x]` | Model installer (HF download) | 2026-03-19 — Hugging Face Hub download with live per-file progress when dry-run planning is available, faster fallback progress refresh, compatibility with newer `huggingface_hub` progress kwargs, conservative capability inference during registration, and local readiness provenance recording |
| `[x]` | Model installer (URL download) | 2026-03-19 — httpx streaming with resume support and continuously refreshed progress output |
| `[x]` | Format detector (MLX/GGUF/safetensors) | 2026-03-19 — auto-detection pipeline with unsupported-backend-aware repair for stale registry entries |
| `[x]` | Backend base class (ABC) | 2026-03-17 — already existed from Phase 2 |
| `[x]` | MLX backend | 2026-03-19 — macOS Apple Silicon, lazy mlx-lm import, sampler-based generation compatibility, and best-effort cancellation hook |
| `[x]` | GGUF backend | 2026-03-19 — all platforms, lazy llama-cpp-python import, and best-effort cancellation hook |
| `[x]` | Safetensors backend | 2026-03-19 — all platforms, lazy torch/transformers import, plus threaded-stream cancellation via stopping criteria |
| `[x]` | Hardware detection and warnings | 2026-03-18 — CPU/RAM/GPU detection, >80% warning |
| `[x]` | `/models list` command | 2026-03-19 — now adds a compact readiness column for agent availability/confidence |
| `[x]` | `/models search` command | 2026-03-18 |
| `[x]` | `/models install` command | 2026-03-19 — hf and url subcommands, plus `/models` layered picker backed by live Hugging Face family/model discovery across many families |
| `[x]` | `/models remove` command | 2026-03-18 — with file cleanup |
| `[x]` | `/models use` command | 2026-03-18 — hidden compatibility alias behind `/set`, still supports direct selection with hardware warnings |
| `[x]` | `/models inspect` command | 2026-03-19 — now renders per-capability readiness lines with both tier and rationale instead of raw booleans |
| `[x]` | Model versioning | 2026-03-18 — auto-increment v1/v2, name@version syntax |

---

## Phase 4 — Chat Mode

| Status | Component | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `[x]` | Chat controller | 2026-03-18 — `localagentcli/agents/chat.py` routes chat turns through the model abstraction layer |
| `[x]` | Streaming output renderer | 2026-03-19 — renderer now owns the shared output contract for status, success, warning, error, and secondary-detail lanes; late-arriving secondary detail is flushed once at safe boundaries instead of disappearing after the first primary text, and step/task activity wording is now normalized (`Step N started`, `Task completed`) |
| `[x]` | Reasoning panel display | 2026-03-19 — chat, direct-answer, and planned-agent reasoning now all use the same dimmed `Details` lane rather than mixing separate reasoning presentations |
| `[x]` | Context compactor (auto-summarization) | 2026-03-18 — `localagentcli/session/compactor.py` summarizes older history once context threshold is exceeded |
| `[x]` | Pinned instructions | 2026-03-19 — retained on `Session`, combined with auto-detected repository `AGENTS.md` instructions, and preserved by `ChatController` across compaction |
| `[x]` | `/mode chat` command | 2026-03-19 — mode changes now use shared success/warning presentation for normal switches and cancelled stop-confirmation paths |
| `[x]` | `/mode agent` command | 2026-03-19 — mode switching implemented in Phase 4, now activates the Phase 5 agent workflow, uses shared success/status presentation for readiness guidance, rejects untrusted remote fallback states explicitly, and returns parent-command subcommand errors with explicit `/help mode` recovery guidance |
| `[x]` | Status header display | 2026-03-19 — replaced by a persistent prompt-time status toolbar showing mode, active target, workspace, and a short hint; `/status` uses the same snapshot data in expanded form, and the toolbar now keeps agent-mode state explicit with an `agent: idle` label when no task is running |
| `[x]` | Input history (up/down arrows) | 2026-03-18 — prompt history is session-backed and persisted via session metadata |
| `[x]` | Tab completion for commands | 2026-03-18 — live slash-command menu, typed filtering, arrow-key navigation, and Tab acceptance via prompt-toolkit |

---

## Phase 5 — Agent System

| Status | Component | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `[x]` | Tool base class (ABC) | 2026-03-18 |
| `[x]` | Tool registry | 2026-03-18 |
| `[x]` | `file_read` tool | 2026-03-18 |
| `[x]` | `file_search` tool | 2026-03-18 |
| `[x]` | `directory_list` tool | 2026-03-18 |
| `[x]` | `file_write` tool | 2026-03-18 |
| `[x]` | `patch_apply` tool | 2026-03-18 |
| `[x]` | `shell_execute` tool | 2026-03-18 |
| `[x]` | `test_execute` tool | 2026-03-18 |
| `[x]` | `git_status` tool | 2026-03-18 |
| `[x]` | `git_diff` tool | 2026-03-18 |
| `[x]` | `git_commit` tool | 2026-03-18 |
| `[x]` | Agent controller | 2026-03-19 — session-integrated task orchestration now includes triage-based direct-answer fast path, single-step synthesis, controller reuse, remote capability validation by selected model id, interruption-aware cancellation, persisted `agent_task_state` snapshots, and explicit stopped vs timed-out vs failed outcomes |
| `[x]` | Agent loop (understand/plan/execute/observe) | 2026-03-19 — iterative per-step execution now accepts synthesized plans, enforces inactivity timeout, surfaces named runtime phases (`planning`, `executing`, `waiting_approval`, `replanning`, `recovering`, `stopped`, `timed_out`, `completed`, `failed`), and replans around repeated failures before terminating |
| `[x]` | Task planner | 2026-03-19 — model-driven JSON plans with heuristic fallback and replan support, now generating only the minimum number of steps needed instead of a fixed 2-6 step shape |
| `[x]` | Agent events system | 2026-03-19 — structured route, phase, plan, step, reasoning, tool, completion, stopped, timeout, and failure events rendered by the shell, with approval-risk and rollback-preview metadata flowing into the renderer |
| `[x]` | `/agent approve` command | 2026-03-19 — resumes pending tool actions and now persists autonomous approvals across future tasks in the shell and future sessions while still forcing explicit approval for high-risk actions |
| `[x]` | `/agent deny` command | 2026-03-19 — rejects the pending tool action and returns the loop to recovery/replanning as needed |
| `[x]` | `/agent undo` command | 2026-03-19 — reverts the most recent rollback entry recorded for the current session and refuses to run while an agent task is active |
| `[x]` | `/agent undo-all` command | 2026-03-19 — reverts all rollback entries recorded for the current session in reverse order and refuses to run while an agent task is active |
| `[x]` | Ctrl+C agent stop path | 2026-03-19 — stops the active agent task from the shell, cancels active generation when supported, records a warning-style stop state instead of a generic failure, and exits the idle shell after a consecutive double press without prompting to save |

---

## Phase 6 — Safety

| Status | Component | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `[x]` | Safety layer (central gate) | 2026-03-19 — `localagentcli/safety/layer.py` now validates boundaries, classifies risk, explains why high-risk actions were flagged, describes rollback availability up front, applies approval policy, and records rollback history around successful tool execution |
| `[x]` | Approval manager (balanced mode) | 2026-03-18 — central safety gate now enforces prompts for standard side-effecting actions and read-only high-risk actions |
| `[x]` | Approval manager (autonomous mode) | 2026-03-19 — autonomous mode auto-approves standard actions, persists correctly across future tasks, and still pauses high-risk operations for explicit approval |
| `[x]` | Approval UX (inline prompts) | 2026-03-19 — inline prompts now flush pending renderer detail before blocking for input, use the shared action-prompt surface for approve/deny/details/approve-all, and render tool-specific previews with target, risk, warning, overwrite/create, and rollback context |
| `[x]` | Workspace boundary enforcement | 2026-03-18 — dedicated `WorkspaceBoundary` enforces root confinement for tool paths and shell working directories |
| `[x]` | Symlink validation | 2026-03-18 — symlinks resolving outside the workspace root are blocked centrally and in shared path resolution helpers |
| `[x]` | High-risk action detection | 2026-03-18 — shell commands and sensitive file paths are classified centrally so high-risk actions always require approval |
| `[x]` | Rollback manager (file backups) | 2026-03-18 — `RollbackManager` stores per-session backups and a JSON rollback log under `cache/rollback/` |
| `[x]` | Undo capability | 2026-03-19 — rollback history supports `undo_last()` and `undo_all()` restoration for modified and newly created files, with Windows-safe modified-file restore behavior plus explicit `/agent undo` and `/agent undo-all` command surfaces |

---

## Phase 7 — Packaging

| Status | Component | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `[x]` | `pyproject.toml` configuration | 2026-03-18 — production metadata, project URLs, license files, classifiers, and release tooling extras added |
| `[x]` | Backend auto-install on demand | 2026-03-18 — shell prompts to install missing MLX/GGUF/Torch dependencies and installs direct backend requirements before retrying model load |
| `[x]` | Unit tests | 2026-03-19 — 775 tests total across unit, component, integration, and CLI coverage, now including regressions for readiness provenance, provider discovery state, startup default-target repair warnings, agent route/phase visibility, approval persistence, richer approval previews, `/agent undo` flows, and warning-style stopped/timed-out rendering; full suite passes at 85.16% coverage |
| `[x]` | Integration tests | 2026-03-18 — setup/save/load and backend auto-install flows covered in `tests/integration/test_packaging_flows.py` |
| `[x]` | CLI tests | 2026-03-18 — subprocess coverage for interactive and non-interactive first-run setup, session restore, single- and double-`Ctrl+C` handling in `tests/cli/test_packaging_cli.py`, with a Windows-safe non-interactive interrupt path |
| `[x]` | Agent workflow tests | 2026-03-18 — planner, controller, shell integration, provider tool-calling, and `/agent` command coverage added |
| `[x]` | Safety tests | 2026-03-18 — added boundary, rollback, safety-layer, and high-risk approval coverage |
| `[x]` | Cross-platform testing (macOS) | 2026-03-17 — via CI matrix |
| `[x]` | Cross-platform testing (Linux) | 2026-03-17 — via CI matrix |
| `[x]` | Cross-platform testing (Windows) | 2026-03-18 — added `windows-latest` to the GitHub Actions test matrix |
| `[~]` | PyPI release | 2026-03-18 — build artifacts, README rendering, `twine check`, publish workflow, and local `pipx` install are validated; final upload still requires PyPI/TestPyPI project setup, trusted-publisher configuration, and a pushed release tag |

---

## CI / Workflows

| Status | Component | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `[x]` | `.github/workflows/test.yml` | 2026-03-18 — pytest + coverage on ubuntu/macos/windows × py3.11-3.13, plus package build, `twine check`, and `pipx` smoke verification through the resolved `PIPX_BIN_DIR` entrypoint |
