# LocalAgentCLI — Current State

> **Last updated**: 2026-03-18 (Phase 7 hardening complete in-repo — primary `localagentcli` entrypoint, non-interactive prompt fallback for Windows/CI, non-interactive first-run `/setup` fallback for piped `pipx` and CI launches, cross-platform path normalization, live slash-command menu, layered Hugging Face `/models` picker, Windows-safe rollback restore, build + twine validation, workflows using `pipx` bin-dir discovery instead of hard-coded venv paths, and local `pipx` install verified on-device; actual PyPI upload still depends on repository-side trusted-publishing setup and a pushed release tag)

## How to Update

After implementing a component:
1. Change its status marker from `[ ]` to `[~]` (in progress) or `[x]` (done)
2. Add the date of the status change
3. Add brief notes if relevant (e.g., "partial — missing streaming support")
4. Commit this file as part of your implementation work

**Status markers:**
- `[ ]` — Not started
- `[~]` — In progress
- `[x]` — Done

| Status | Component | Notes |
|---|---|---|

| `[x]` | Approval manager (autonomous mode) | 2026-03-18 — autonomous mode auto-approves standard actions but still pauses high-risk operations for explicit approval |

| `[~]` | PyPI release | 2026-03-18 — build artifacts, README rendering, `twine check`, publish workflow, and local `pipx` install are validated; final upload still requires PyPI/TestPyPI project setup, trusted-publisher configuration, and a pushed release tag |
